This is an old project of mine, from my high school days.
It is a set of libraries that allow you to use infrared LEDs/receivers (similar to those on DVRs/TVs) to talk to each other.
It also implements the Phillips/SONY protocols for remote controlling TVs. You can use this code to know what the codes are for your remote, and build a remote controller with an AVR microcontroller.
Since I have not had a chance to look at this code in a long time, it might be woefully underdocumented, and there are no wiring instructions.
I remember it was a lot of fun writing it, and I hope you have fun going through it/trying it out (maybe prank your friends?).
